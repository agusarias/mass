## About Mass

Mass is a playground to learn how a *traditional web application* (a.k.a. No-SPA) should be structured, making full use of a modern JavaScript framework as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs) framework. 

**This is not a best practice's guide**, it's a project to find (and solve) difficulties when trying to implement a *tradicional yet modern* web app.
